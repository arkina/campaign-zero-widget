Campaign Zero Widget
===

Usage Instructions
---

To use this script, you simply need to add the following code anywhere on your website that you want the widget to show up:

```html
<script async src="https://embed.joincampaignzero.org/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

This will inject a widget into a newly created HTML element with the ID `campaign-zero-widget` directly above where you placed our script.


Alternate Usage Instructions
---

If you are unable to place JavaScript where you want the widget to go, you can use the following HTML directly:

```html
<div id="campaign-zero-widget"></div>
```

Then, include the following script tag anywhere else on your page:

```html
<script async src="https://embed.joincampaignzero.org/widget.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

If you are using something like WordPress that just asks you for the URL for the script to put in your footer, you can use the following URL:

```
https://embed.joincampaignzero.org/widget.js
```
